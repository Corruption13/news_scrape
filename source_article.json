We are paying the interest on loans etc. to banks, exports orders are being cancelled... Due to the shutdown several industry sectors are not in a position to deliver the orders within the stipulated time to buyers, hence the buyers are not just cancelling the order but also imposing penalties,\u201d he told The Hindu.\n\n\u201cEvery year the demand for power rises during the paddy sowing season, which is not something new. Even credible weather forecast mechanism is available, yet we are facing such situation, which is unfortunate,\u201d said Mr. Jindal.\n\nPunjab\u2019s average electricity demand during the ongoing paddy season has been more than 14,500 MW, against average supply of 13,500 MW. The PSPCL on July 5 in a statement stated that on average 10.3 hours of electricity across the State was supplied for paddy operations.", "authors": ["One Got The Certificate Saying She Was Fully Vaccinated Even Though She Did Not Receive Her Second Dose", "Another Received A Provisional Certificate For Her First Dose Without Even Getting A Jab", "A Video Feature On The Residents Of Balkote", "Silikote In The Wake Of The India-Pakistan Ceasefire"], "publish_date": null, "keywords": ["power", "curbs", "rising", "pspcl", "average", "punjab", "demand", "units", "industrial", "forces", "till", "agri", "paddy", "industry", "consumers", "state"]}}, {"title": "\nTension in Bengal district after man dies in police custody; two policemen suspended  | Kolkata, 17:59\n", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/tension-in-bengal-district-after-man-dies-in-police-custody-two-policemen-suspended/article35169637.ece", "data": {"content": "A 21-year-old man died in police custody in Bengal\u2019s Paschim Bardhaman district on July 6 morning, triggering tension in the area, as locals hurled stones at the outpost, where he was held, and torched several vehicles stationed outside, a senior officer said.\n\nA complaint was lodged by the father of the deceased, following which the two police officers, who had arrested him on July 5 night for his involvement in a theft case, were suspended, he said.\n\n\u201cThe health condition of the accused deteriorated in custody.
